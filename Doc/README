ThinkSQL Linux Release 1.03
===========================

Installation:
Create a backup copy of any existing db1.dat sample catalog file.

Extract the files from the archive, e.g.

  tar -xzvf thinkSQLlinux.tar.gz

To use the dbExpress driver with Kylix, move the dbExpress driver,
libsqlthink.so.0, into the kylix/bin directory.


Server
------
The server can be started from the command line, e.g.

	 ./ThinkSQL
	 
(Obviously an optional '&' can be added to send the process into the
background.)

Note: you must start the server process in the directory containing the 
primary catalog (e.g. db1.dat) and thinkSQL.lic files.


Clients
-------
Telnet (echo on):
The following command will open a connection to the server
(on the same machine):

	telnet localhost 9075
	
Press <return> to get the ThinkSQL Welcome prompt.
Type:

	connect to 'thinksql' user 'restaurant';
	
to connect to the sample restaurant schema, otherwise the first command will
automatically connect as 'default'.
See the User Guide for more details and remember to end each command 
with a semi-colon (;) (or a full-stop (.) on a line of its own if the
command contains a block of statements, e.g. create function).


ISQLraw:
This program requires the Qt 2.2.4 libraries.
If Kylix is installed, issuing:

	source <KYLIXPATH>/bin/kylixpath
	
will make these libraries available (replace <KYLIXPATH> with the path to
the Kylix directory).

Alternatively, download the thinkSQLlinuxQt.tar.gz file from
http://www.thinksql.co.uk and extract this into the same directory as the
ISQLraw program. Running:

	./startISQLraw
	
will then start the client using the local shared libraries.
Select Connection|Connect to connect to the server.


dbExpress (API for Kylix):
Make sure the 'libsqlthink.so.0' file has been moved into the 
Kylix 'bin' directory.
Edit the 'dbxdrivers' file which is found in the Kylix user's home directory
in a hidden folder name '.borland'. Add the following line to the
[Installed Drivers] section:
	THINKSQL=1
	
And add the following section to the file to describe the new driver:
	[THINKSQL]
	GetDriverFunc=getSQLDriverTHINKSQL
	LibraryName=libsqlthink.so.0
	VendorLib=libsqlthink.so.0
	BlobSize=-1
	Database=thinksql
	HostName=localhost
	Password=
	User_Name=DEFAULT

Add the following section to the dbxconnections file (in the same directory)
to describe a default connection:
	[ThinkSQL]
	BlobSize=-1
	Database=thinksql
	DriverName=THINKSQL
	HostName=localhost
	Password=
	User_Name=DEFAULT

These two files are used by Kylix to set default parameters for the driver.
They are not needed for deployment. See the Kylix help for more details.

The dbExpress driver should now be available to use from Kylix.


JDBC:
See the User Guide file for details.

Python DB-API module:
