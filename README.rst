ThinkSQL Relational Database Management System - Source Code
============================================================

            Copyright Â© 2000-2018  Greg Gaughan

This is the source code for the ThinkSQL database system.

The source code is linear per se, but while writing it, it was an organic 
thing, generating great interwoven trees in the computer memory and in my 
head that were many-layered and that were modified and traversed, and 
impacted on a dynamic multi-versioned data store alongside many other 
threads, causing and needing deep psychological flow.
The code comments are released as-is, and are often streams-of-consciousness.
