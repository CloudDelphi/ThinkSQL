This is the source code for the ThinkSQL database server. It was written in
Object Pascal and developed in Delphi (v5/6). It needs Delphi or Kylix to 
build, although conversion to Lazarus should be straightforward.

It requires:
	Indy (v9) TCP/IP networking components
	DCPcrypt (v2) encryption routines
	Lex and Yacc - for modifying the parser

All source code is written by Greg Gaughan, except:
	MultiMM - Robert Lee
	lexlib.pas & yacclib.pas - Albert Graef / Berend de Boer
	sqlcli.h C header file for SQL/CLI - Gulutzan & Pelzer
